***HANGMAN!***
1) Output a brief description of the game of hangman and how to play
2) Ask the user to enter the word or phrase that will be guessed 
(have a friend enter the phrase for you if you want to be surprised)
3) Output the appropriate number of dashes and spaces to represent 
the phrase (make sure itâ€™s clear how many letters are in each word and
how many words there are)
4) Continuously read guesses of a letter from the user and fill in the 
corresponding blanks if the letter is in the word, otherwise report that
the user has made an incorrect guess.
5) Each turn you will display the phrase as dashes but with any already 
guessed letters filled in, as well as which letters have been incorrectly guessed so far and how many guesses 
the user has remaining.
6) Your program should allow the user to make a total of k=6 guesses.
7) You MUST use at least 3 string methods or operators in a useful manner
 (several examples that I used are given in the notes below).  If you wish
to use lists in your project that is fine, as long as you meet this 
requirement.
